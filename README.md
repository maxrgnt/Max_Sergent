The concept of the app was to create a customized variant of LinkedIn or a mobile resume. 

ALL of the data visible on load is either synced from a Firebase database or loaded in from CoreData (it gets saved to CoreData each time a fresh pull from Firebase occurs). With this design, all text, icons, and even color schemes present in the app are FULLY customizable without the user ever knowing an update occured, and most importantly without having to ask the user to update to a newer version from the App Store.
