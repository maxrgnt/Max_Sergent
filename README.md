# Max_Sergent
The "Max Sergent" app project is a supplement for my iOS developer application.

The concept of the app was to create a customized variant of LinkedIn or a mobile resume. ALL of the data present on load is either refreshed from a Firebase database or loaded in from CoreData (it gets saved to CoreData each time a fresh pull from Firebase occurs). With this design, all text, icons, and even color schemes found within the app are FULLY customizable without having to ask the user to re-update the app from the App Store.
